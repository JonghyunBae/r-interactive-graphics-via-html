  # KineticJS and browser compatibility issue: 
   * Should we stick to KineticJS?
   * Should we adapt something else, e.g. jQuary for its broad support?
   * Should we even write our own code?
  # Should we try to collaborate with RStudio/Shiny?
   * This will help us reduce some uncertainty in server offloading and may make our work more useful/popular.  
   * Look into Shiny documentation for initial assessment.
    * http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/
    * http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/shiny.pdf
   * Will this incur license issues (Shiny is GPL-3)?
   * Set the [ServersideScenario server-offload] protocol.
  # How should the R API look like? 
   * Should it be a variant of base graphics (less risk)? 
   * Should it be similar to ggplot2 (more risk)? We may be able to use ggplot_build() and reduce risk while adopting the ggplot2 syntax.
  # Deep dive into event handling interface. See EventHandling for more details.
  # Where should we create an interface between R and JavaScript to minimize effort and support various plot types?

* Research *
 # Shiny uses "Fast bidirectional communication between the web browser and R using the websockets package".
  * Websockets package is under LGPL-3 license.
   * http://illposed.net/websockets.html
   * http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/websockets/vignettes/websockets.pdf
  * Websockets package is possible to be adjusted in our code(need more study).
  * Reactive issue in shiny is the difference with our concept.
 # KineticJS
  * There is a bug report slot for users  (https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS/issues?page=1&state=open).
  * Keep changing syntax.

  # Discussion for the next step
   * Remove "delete" function, and add "ctrl+z" for "hide" function.
   * Make to work both box drag search and boolean expression search at the same time. (When searching with boolean statements, [ans] saves not only expression, but also nodes themselves. )
   * Think about histogram bin size later
   * When resizing graphs, set the minimum size.
   * R code generation. (Dr. Jung Hoon Lee will give it to us.)
   * Draw charts (html5) on R.
   * Implement other basic graphs with refining old graphs. ( box-and-whisker )
   * Try other data sets( Try with discontinuous data set)
   * Make another directory for box-and-whisker graph, and put the common parts with scatter and hist graph into one file.
  # Report challenge
   * Better performance when driving large data set.
   * Refine the codes to work with various data set. (including discontinuous data and different x variable in histogram)

Next meeting : 10:00 AM (Korea time) on Sat, 3/16

Date : 24/02/2013

participants : Jung Hoon Lee, Chung Ha Sung, Taejoon Song.

Contents
  # Discussion for the next step
   * Add functionality of mouse right click(e.g. hide)
   * Add functionality of the search box(e.g. [ans], delete, reset)
   * Modify the information box and add transition select.
   * Add a text box for histogram of diff.
  # Report challenge
   * Hierarchy the data layer for driving large data set.
  # Later purpose
   * Abstract each function(e.g. framework) to make the project comfortable for many charts.
   * Complete the prototype.
 
Next meeting : TBD.

Contents

  # Report challenges 
   * Figuring out solutions to resolve finding conflict the same node ids which are in different stages or layers in order to remove select layer which make the program heavy. -> should know exact function of a node finding function and understand kinetic library(relation between stage and node).
   * The program is not compatible with every browser. -> should be compatible with Firefox first, other browser later(priority low).
  # Discussion for the next step
   * Make prototype first at least until 1st week on March.
   * Set the prototype level 
    # Interactive selection node graph with many datasets without any bug.
    # Searching box(boolean language) using javascript.
    # Information box of each node.
  # Later purpose
   * Abstract each function(e.g. framework) to make the project comfortable for many charts.
   * Divide work(e.g. R code generation & Server offloading).

Next meeting : 01:00 PM (which is 11:00 PM in NJ Time) on Sun, 2/24 through skype.

  # Environment Settings
   * Set up the google code and SVN directory to manage the project.
   * Make the project name "---------".
   * Share emails and add google talk ID.
   * Set up conference call schedules : once per two weeks 
  # First action item
   * Implement drawing function on client side. ex) drawDot, drawLine, plot, point, axis, axisLabel
    # Consider data structure. (ex. array)
    # Should be similar to other languages in order to make it easy for code generation. (HTML5 vs Javascripts)
