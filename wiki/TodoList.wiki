==TODO list for the project==

{{{
* [John Doe] indicates "assigned to John Doe"
}}}

=== Short Term ===

  * [TJ, CH] Tool-tip
  * [TJ, CH] Selection of multiple points by shift/ctrl + click (you probably need, for instance, isSelected column in your data structure)
  * [TJ, CH] Bar chart example
  * Interactive tool-tip between bar chart and scatter plot (if computational burden is not high) or interactive multiple selection
  * Identifying the biggest problem the prototype can comfortably handle
  * User-specified details of the points selected. For Theoph example, it will list Subject, Dose, Time, and conc (but not Wt) of the selected points. The table should support left-right (for many columns) and top-down scrolling. 

=== Longer Term ===

  * R interface & code generation
  * Server offloading
  * [JW, JH] Licensing terms
