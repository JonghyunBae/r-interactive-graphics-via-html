Description: Interactive data visualization supporting linked graphs can help users easily 
    explore data and gain valuable insights. RIGHT enables such visualization and interactive 
    re-analysis using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. Its R API is designed to create a seamless 
    analysis, visualization, and re-analysis workflow for interactive visualization and analysis. 
    Since HTML5 canvas and JavaScript is supported in virtually all modern web browsers, the 
    visualizations can be delivered to almost any device/platform for presentation purposes.
