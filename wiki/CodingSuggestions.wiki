Here are a few coding suggestions. Please delete the entries that are already addressed.

= High Priority =
 * Please clean up the repository:
  * Please do not create directories under 'trunk' to keep track of release versions; we should do this with tagging. As a first step, let's tag the version used to create the demo video using the code under trunk.
  * Reflect all the proven changes under 'ch_test' and 'box_text' to trunk to have the latest code. 
  * Please do not create a branch unless you are trying something very different or uncertain. Instead, apply the changes directly to 'trunk'.
  * Never check in a broken code into 'trunk'.
 * Let's include copyright statements into the code.
