After installing RIGHT package successfully, you can draw your own interactive graphs very easily.

Since RIGHT syntax is based on R-basic graphic, even beginners can use RIGHT package with ease. You just need to wrap R-basic syntax with RIGHT bracket.

For example, in original R, you can draw basic scatter grpahs like below.

{{{
> plot(price ~ carat, diamonds, type="p")
}}}
 
And it will show like below graph.

Now, what you need to get our RIGHT graph is just wrapping with RIGHT bracket.
{{{
> RIGHT(plot(price ~ carat, diamonds, type="p"))
}}}

Finally you can get the exactly same graph, but beautiful and interactive one, on your default browser!
